# Age and Gender Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates age and gender detection on images using OpenCV's deep learning (DNN) module and pre-trained models.

---

## Overview

- Detects faces in an image using a pre-trained face detection model.
- Predicts the age group and gender of each detected face using dedicated DNN models.
- Draws bounding boxes and labels on the image showing the predicted age and gender.

## Face Detection Model:

opencv_face_detector.pbtxt

opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb

## Age Detection Model:

age_deploy.prototxt

age_net.caffemodel

## Gender Detection Model:

gender_deploy.prototxt

gender_net.caffemodel

## Model Files
You need the following model files for the program to work. Place all of them in the same directory as the script:

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/age-gender-detection.git
   cd age-gender-detection

2. **Install required Python packages**
--- ```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib

3.  **Place the model files**
   Download all the required model files (see above) and place them in the project folder.


4.  **Prepare your input image**
  Update the `image_path` variable in `Age.py` with the full path to your input image.


5.  **Run the script**
--- ```bash
   python Age.py

6.  **View the results**
A window will pop up displaying the image with detected faces, predicted ages, and genders.
How It Works

## How It Works
Uses OpenCV DNN to load the face detection model and detect faces.
For each detected face, extracts the region of interest (ROI).
Passes the ROI through pre-trained age and gender models.
Annotates the image with bounding boxes and labels.


## Troubleshooting
Make sure all model files are in the correct directory and paths in the code are accurate.
Verify OpenCV version (4.2+ recommended).
If you encounter file not found errors, double-check model filenames and locations.
For any OpenCV DNN errors, verify model compatibility.
